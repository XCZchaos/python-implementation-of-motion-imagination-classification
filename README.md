# python-implementation-of-motion-imagination-classification
This is just a simple code of how to process EEG data when I learn motor imagination, not necessarily correct, just for reference

In this experiment, CSP and LDA were used for simple classification of EEG data. It is worth noting that at this time, EEG data were not preprocessed and denoised, nor were the subsequent models optimized and adjusted. It was only a simple experiment

This experiment adopts the MNE and sklearn modules in python


And some of my notes from BCI learning are uploaded here, but the notes are in Chinese


One of the files named EEG_MI_ML is a simple experiment of motion imaging left-handed and right-handed binary classification. The experiment involves filtering processing, CSP and LDA, and the mat files related to the experiment are also uploaded
