In this experiment, CSP and LDA were used for simple classification of EEG data. It is worth noting that at this time, EEG data were not preprocessed and denoised, nor were the subsequent models optimized and adjusted. It was only a simple experiment


This experiment adopts the MNE and sklearn modules in python




One of the files named EEG_MI_ML is a simple experiment of motion imaging left-handed and right-handed binary classification. The experiment involves filtering processing, CSP and LDA, and the mat files related to the experiment are also uploaded
